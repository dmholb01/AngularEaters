            rural areas to the suburban communities to urban localities, we are dedicated to extending a helping hand to
            the nearly 200,000 food-insecure children, families and seniors in our service area.</h5>

        <h5 class="subheader">Our Meals on Wheels provides made-from-scratch, nutritious meals to homebound seniors in 14 localities including
            the cities of Richmond, Petersburg, Hopewell and Colonial Heights, as well as the counties of Charles City, Chesterfield,
            Dinwiddie, Goochland, Hanover, Henrico, Louisa, New Kent, Powhatan and Prince George. FeedMore’s Central Virginia
            Food Bank and Partner Agency Network serves 34 counties and cities – nearly one-third of the state – from the
            Northern Neck to Louisa County and south to the North Carolina border.</h5>

        <h5 class="subheader">Food donations make up a critical foundation of our feeding efforts. To help ensure that food is available when and
            where it is most needed, FeedMore must obtain as much food as possible at little to no cost. This takes the contributions
            of individuals, groups and food industry donors, who host food drives, provide food in local drop boxes, and
            donate products for distribution.</h5>
